**texRAMEN**
-----

texRAMEN (text random encryption) is a simple text encryption program that, rather than using a password, generates a file full of metadata to reassemble the text. Without the meta file, the data is completely useless. As such, it can be secured physically on a hard drive, CD, phone, in the cloud, etc. The goal here was not to create the next big thing in cryptography; but instead to add another layer of protection on top of standard file encryption.

**To install:**

Simply mark the file as executable (usually `chmod +x`) and run it. It has no special dependencies outside of `touch` and `python3`.
